# RestAPI

A python flask REST API with a flask SQL-Alchemy database

This is a mock API that allows you to query data and make requests from a database.
This API is setup like a video player clone so users can query views, likes, and the name of the video.
Different requests (put, get, patch) could be made to query/update the database if wanted.

This was created to get a better understanding of how APIs work and dip my toes in Flask.

If you want to check it out use pip to install the requirements.txt file then run the main.py file 
to start Flask and run test.py to query the database
